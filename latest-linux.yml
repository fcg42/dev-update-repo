  ### 2.0.17

  * Important Change: The "partial" distances are now computed from the end user's perspective. This also applies to the TSD spreadsheets.

      * The Partial Distance in versions <= 2.0.16 was also calculated in high precision and ROUNDED for display.

      * The Partial Distance in version 2.0.17 and later is calculated so that the displayed values in the roadbook "make sense" to the competitor. That is to say, the mathematics of the displayed roadbook is obvious and reconcilable.

  Example:

  | Actual GPS Partial / Total | Old partial / Total | New Partial / Total |
  |----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
  | 0.000 / 0.000              | 0.00 / 0.00         | 0.00 / 0.00         |            
  | 1.556 / 1.556              | 1.56 / 1.56         | 1.56 / 1.56         |            
  | 1.556 / 3.112              | 1.56 / 3.11         | _**1.55**_ / 3.11     |            
  | 1.556 / 4.668              | 1.56 / 4.67         | 1.56 / 4.67         |            
  | 1.556 / 6.224              | 1.56 / 6.22         | _**1.55**_ / 6.22     |            
  | 1.556 / 7.780              | 1.56 / 7.78         | 1.56 / 7.78         |            
  | 1.556 / 9.336              | 1.56 / 9.34         | 1.56 / 9.34         |
